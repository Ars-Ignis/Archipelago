# Crystalis

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Many things can be randomized in Crystalis, but primarily chests, items that come from NPCs, and enemies
are shuffled in this game.

## What is the goal of this game?

Defeat Draygon 2 in the Crypt, climb the Tower, get Crystalis from Mesia, and defeat Dyna! If you have the Story Mode 
option on, this also requires defeating all the Tetrarchs and collecting all four swords.

## What changes from the vanilla game should I know about before playing this randomizer?

- In order to make the game more non-linear while not making combat potentially outrageously difficult early on, all
enemies in the game are scaled based on the number of unique items you have received. This scaling is indicated by 
the number next to the DL (Difficulty Level) in the HUD. It increases enemy health, defense, attack, experience, and 
gold, as well as increasing the price of tool shops and inns, and decreasing the price of armor shops. (The shop 
changes can be reverted with the Vanilla Shops option.)
- By default, the randomizer adds a cave to the right side of Wind Valley, based on the Game Boy Color version of the 
game. This cave has two chests blocked by nothing and two other exits, one of which is blocked by a breakable wall
(weak to wind by default). These exits lead to two of Cordel Plains, Lime Valley, Goa Valley, and Desert 2, decided at 
random. This behavior can be changed with the Vanilla Flags option.
- (More TBD)
